            <p class="mb-0">Prior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NonStop_(server_computers)" target="_blank">HP NonStop</a> application developer turned loose as an open source full-stack web developer back in late 2014.<br/>
                Basically, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F" target="_blank" >'who moved my cheese'</a> kind of situation.  This did not come as a surprise to me, as I could see it coming,<br/>
                and as such started my search for new and interesting development work.  In 2015, I discovered Laravel and have been working with it ever since,<br/>
                and am currently working at rateGenius.com in Austin Texas as a full-stack Laravel developer.</p>
